## COVER LETTER

Dear Future Employer

With this letter, I would like to express my interest in working at your company!

I am software developer with advanced knowledge in various technologies and hands-on experience using object oriented languages to create and implement state-of-the-art applications. I am confident that I will be proven asset to your organization... woooohooo no. Nope. This won't be that kind of cover letter which can be easily found on internet and a bit refactored. This will be one-in-a-kind cover letter from semi-serious software sorcerer! So why should you choose me among your other candidates ? Answer is really simple because you won't find second dev like me. I got this spark of reaching far beyond limits in terms of gaining knowledge and I am always trying to push things forward. So in terms of soft dev I think it means to implement & design and in general to produce soft that is excellent in all imaginable categories.  

Sounds good right ? If you project hit the wall and you need a guy who will break that wall then you are speaking with the right person. I like bringing latest tech-ideas to projects I am involved into and I am always giving 100% of my magic to make project successful. I am quickly adapting to new environment so I can speed-up knowledge sharing to reduce my project-introduction time. Software Engineering since a long time is my fairy tale so I got required skills to every type of assignment and there are no impossible task for me.

Like Master Yoda said - Code is strong in this one! 

All best,  
Chris Madej
